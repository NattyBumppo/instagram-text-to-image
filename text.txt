-----

Kenji Miyazawa (1896–1933) was a Japanese poet and author known for his works for children. His writings  intertwine themes of nature, Buddhism, and social justice. Miyazawa's most notable pieces include "Night on the Galactic Railroad," "Gauche the Cellist," and "The Restaurant of Many Orders." Although his literary contributions were largely overlooked during his lifetime, they have since become celebrated and influential in Japanese literature.

Back in those days, Kazeho field was really a sight to behold.

Among the blue-green reeds, glistening brambles, and tall grasses with feathery seed heads like smoke, here and there alders and chestnut trees clustered in small thickets.

-----

Nowadays, passing through on a steam locomotive, the field is still quite beautiful in its use as a military training ground and as a nursery for saplings–filled with soldiers on their shining horses, and people working the fields in their white shirts.

But it was even more lovely, before.

-----

In September, we would head out to the field every day. More often than not, I would go out there with Keijirō Fujiwara.

The kids from the city only came on Sundays. No matter when we went, we always found lots of hatsutake and chestnuts. We often went quite deep into the field, but on Sundays we would go even farther back.

-----

One Sunday at the end of September, I invited Keijirō to go out early in the morning. We came to the entrance of the field like always. There, we saw a single white sign next to a chestnut tree by the road. We were already fifth graders by then, so we had no trouble reading what was written.

-----

"Due to a visit from the Director General of the Northeast Region today, this area is off-limits. –Northeast Regional Directorate"

-----

I was crestfallen. Keijirō, his face reddening, read the sign over and over.

"So the bigwigs are coming! What a pain," I said. "I don't want to get in trouble. Let's go back."

-----

But Keijirō replied, with some anger in his voice, "Who cares? Let's go in. This field belongs to the Emperor, not some constable or whatever. Let's go way, way back."

-----

Suddenly, I felt excited.

"Hey, I wanna see this ‘Director General of the Northeast Region.' What do you reckon he looks like?"

-----

"He'll have a beard and glasses, I'm sure. Just like that government minister that came the other day."

"Let's find a hiding spot and watch them."

"Yeah, good idea. How about we hide in Temple Grove?"

-----


Temple Grove was located at what is now the northern edge of the military training ground, but back then, it was the most beautiful spot in the entire field. It consisted of a wide area of short, soft grass surrounded by a ring of alders on all sides. It was almost like its own little park.

-----

We decided to hide and watch from within those alder trees.

"Let's do it. We'd better hurry before they find us."

"Okay. Let's run."

-----

We ran along the path through the field as fast as our legs would carry us. We would stop to catch our breath, then start walking, our faces towards the sky. Then we'd glance behind us, and we'd run some more. We ran and ran, until we finally reached Temple Grove. There, we left the path, and hid amongst the alder trees.

-----

But the insects were buzzing loudly, and every now and then, hundreds of birds would swoop through the trees above us in huge flocks. It seemed like no one would ever come down the path. So gradually, we forgot our fears, and as the tall reeds rustled about us under the alder trees, we started to look for hatsutake.

-----

We found lots of them, as we always did. After a while, I was fully engrossed in picking mushrooms, having forgotten all about the Director General.

-----

Suddenly, Keijirō was at my side, his mouth to my ear, whispering softly.

"They're here, they're here! They're finally here. Look!"

-----

I peeked through the reeds back in the direction from which we'd come. Two officials were coming down the path in a great hurry. And now, they had left the path, and seemed to be heading toward our grove. We could hardly breathe. They drew nearer and nearer.

-----

"This must be the grove. I'm sure of it," said one of the officials, a burly, red-faced man wearing a navy-colored uniform with a standup collar.

"Yes, it is. No doubt about it," said the other man, who was wearing a black suit.

-----

Well then. There was no doubt in our minds that we were about to be killed. We'd thought the officials would have just passed by our grove without noticing us, but they must have set up a watch and spotted us. We would be killed, or at least arrested.

-----

I looked over to Keijirō. Sure enough, his face was pale, and his lips were dry and white. I dreaded the thought of being arrested and paraded through our town by the officials, forced to show the mushrooms I'd picked to everyone. I spoke to Keijirō in a low voice.

-----

"We're going to be captured. Captured, I swear it. Let's get rid of the mushrooms. Let's throw them away."

Keijirō said nothing, but silently threw the mushrooms on the ground, wicker basket and all. I gently let go of my basket's strap as well.

-----

But it seemed like the two officials hadn't come here to catch us, after all.

-----

They were wandering around with their eyes focused up in the trees. And then, they stopped right in front of the grove, and were busy with something or another for a while. I did my best to watch them through the reeds. They were both holding what looked like large flour sacks under their arms, and were untying their openings as they stood.

-----

"This spot is as good as any other," said one of the officials.

"Yes, it's fine," said the other. I heard a rustling clatter from their direction. They had definitely dumped something onto the ground. Of course, I was scared, but I desperately wanted to know what it was that they'd dropped.

-----

The officials gradually made their way around to the alders on the other side, dropping the contents of their sacks as they went. Suddenly, one of them spoke.

-----

"Hey, we messed up. This is no good. We really blew it. Do you still have a lot of them in your bag?"

"What do you mean? Is this the wrong grove?" the other asked, surprised.

-----

"Don't you get it?" he explained, his voice calm. "I don't know what kind of trees these are, but they're not chestnut trees. You drop a bunch of chestnuts around here, and the jig will be up, for sure."

"Hmpf. Not to worry. I already thought of that. Listen to you, going on and on. If they ask where the chestnuts came from, we'll just say the wind blew them over here."

-----

"No, that won't work. No good… let's go somewhere where we see chestnut trees. Ah, here we go! Here we go. A chestnut tree! We can say that they came from here. Phew, thank goodness. Come on, let's drop lots of them under here."

"Sure."

-----

Next, I heard the clattering of chestnuts bouncing down against the tree trunk for a while. Keijirō and I glanced at each other. We knew we would be okay–these two officials hadn't come to kill us. They didn't even know we were here! The world suddenly seemed brighter than ever.

-----

It occurred to both of us that if we were to run away, now was as good a time as ever. Our eyes met for only a moment, and then we both stood up as one. We began to walk, gently parting the reeds as we went.

-----

But a moment later, one of the officials called out.

"Someone's there! And after we put up that sign saying not to enter!"

"Who's there?" shouted the other.

-----

This was it–we'd really messed up now. What an idiotic thing we'd done.

The officials, rustling through the reeds, came now to where we were. All around us, the golden sunlight dappled the ground.

-----

"You! Who are you? How'd you get in here?" said the man in the navy clothes. 

At first, we were completely petrified. But then, as he came closer, we saw that official's face, so bright red that it could've been giving off steam, and his nose, sparkling with so many beads of sweat. And suddenly, we didn't feel so scared anymore.

-----

"We came in from over there," I said, pointing towards the path. The official made a serious expression. "Oh, there's a path that way too? Then that's our fault for not putting up a sign there. Right?" He turned to his companion in black, who had just joined him, holding a large, empty sack.

-----

"Right. A couple of boys, huh? But no problem. We just need to get you out of this grove. Come on, boys. Today a really, really important person is coming, so you can't be here. If you wanna stay in the field, you can, but you'll need to go far away. Go all the way to the other end of the field, where you won't be seen. No loud voices, either."

-----`

Keijirō and I looked at each other. Without speaking, we picked up our baskets and made to leave.

Keijirō gave a bow to the men, so I did as well. The navy-clothed official, with the empty sack wrapped around his hand like a dumpling, seemed to bend slightly at the waist. 

-----

We went to leave, when suddenly, the black-clothed official called to us over our shoulders.

"Hey, you kids. Did you pick those mushrooms here?"

Here we go again, I thought, coming to a halt.

-----

But as much as I wanted to deny it, I couldn't say a word. Keijirō replied, "Yeah," his voice cracking as he spoke. The two officials came closer, looking down into our baskets.

-----

"I'll bet there's more, right? Can you show us where we can find lots of these mushrooms? We'll give you a reward."

My mood brightened considerably.

"There's lots more," I said. "Let me get some for you."

-----

But the official in the navy-colored uniform, flustered, waved his hands and shouted. "No, no! Don't pick them! Just tell us where they are. Find them for us."

Electrified, Keijirō and I set out into the reeds.

-----

Right away, I found three hatsutake sitting in a row.

"Here they are!" I yelled.

-----

"Oh yeah?" The officials came to look.

"What? That's only three of them! There will be six people, including the Director General himself. Three mushrooms is no good! Even if they only get ten each, we'll need sixty."

-----

"No problem. We can get sixty mushrooms," said Keijirō, wiping his sweat with his sleeve.

"It's no good if they're spread out all over the field. We'll need to find all of them in one or two places."

-----

"Hatsutake don't grow together like that," I said, feeling more confident.

"Hmpf. Well, no matter. Let's take the mushrooms you've picked and stand them up on the ground around here."

"Good idea," said the official in the black uniform, twirling his thin mustache with his finger.

-----

"Boys, give us all of the mushrooms in your baskets. We'll give you a reward after that," said the man in the navy uniform, laughing. Silent, we handed over our baskets. The two of them knelt down and dumped them onto the ground, counting the mushrooms and returning the smallest ones to the baskets.

-----

"Perfect, there are seventy of them! Let's stand them up around here."

The navy-clothed man did his best to stand a mushroom up among the grasses, but it soon tipped over.

-----

"Hmmm," said the official in black. "Let's use the reeds to skewer the mushrooms. Here, just like this." He took one of the reeds, tore a small piece off, and stuck it into the ground. Then, he placed a mushroom's stem right on top, so that it was standing straight up.

-----

"Great, great. This is perfect! Boys, start tearing the reeds to be about this long."

We couldn't help but laugh, and the officials were laughing, too. The officials began to take the reeds that we'd torn and planted them all over the ground. Then, they skewered all of the mushrooms onto them.

-----

They had really done a remarkable job of it; and yet, it just looked odd. Many of the reeds were bending down, and it was obvious that the mushrooms' stems were torn at the base.

-----

While we laughed at the sight, the official in black grimaced and said, "All right, then. You two go home. Here, you can have these sacks."

"Oh yeah, that's right. Take them as a reward." The two of them threw their sacks to us.

-----

We didn't see the point of having a couple of large sacks, but the officials had become serious again, and it scared us, so we silently accepted the gifts. We then departed from the grove. As we left, we turned back and saw the two officials standing there, intently looking at the makeshift mushroom park that they'd constructed.

-----

Presently, one of them said, "No, the mushroom idea is no good. We'll be in deep water if we're found out."

"Yes, I was also thinking that it's too risky. Let's stop this. We'll gather up all of the mushrooms. We can hide them somewhere, and then we'll give them to the young miss saying we picked them. That'll be safer."

-----

After hearing this, we ran away.

But the officials didn't follow. That evening we took a long detour to get home. We heard that the Director General of the Northeast Region had arrived at the field with his family around noon and had stayed there until evening, all of them having a wonderfully fun time.

-----

The next year, Keijirō and I entered middle school. We saw those two officials every now and then. They were waving around canes as they walked, or carrying packages here and there, or drunk and shouting with red faces at the derby.

-----

We never forgot them. But they always gave us a weird look when they saw us, as if they could've sworn they'd seen these two kids before, but couldn't remember from where.
